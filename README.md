# Build-Insight-Machine-Learning-Classification-With-Telco-Customers
My first project about machine learning during boot camp data science with MySkill. 

Churn Prediction Identifying customers who are likely to cancel their contract soon. If the company can do that, it can handle users before churn The target variable that we want to predict is categorical and has only two possible customers: churn or not churn (Binary Classification) We also would like to understand why the model thinks our company churn and for that, we want need to be able to interpret the models predictions.
